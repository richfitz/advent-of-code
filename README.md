# Advent of code

Solutions to Advent of Code, created as part of our yearly departmental challenge. I've never made it to the last day.

These all use R with only default-loaded packages. Normally I aim for some compromise between fairly small, fairly fast and somewhat readable.

In 2022 I am trying to find what is, to me, the "nicest" solution, and the version here is rarely the exact version used submitting the answer.

In 2023 I am trying to do the puzzle first in Python, though also doing an R solution afterwards.

## Timing and code size information

Running

```
./report <year>
```

prints a report in glorious technicolour with the estimated time to complete each part of the puzzle (plus shared setup cost) and number of "interesting" lines.

## Import from the departmental repo

Running

```
./import <path to repo>
```

will import (overwriting without prompting) solutions from the departmental repo, rewriting code and reorganising inputs to suit this single-user repo.
